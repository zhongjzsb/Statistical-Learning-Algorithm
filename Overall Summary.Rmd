This [Folder](./) contains all the algorithm notebooks.

To modify the automatic-load libraries, change in [.Rprofile](./.Rprofile).

## Data

To see which data are avilable in R.
```{r}
data()
```
More data can be found in package mlbench


## R packages for Machine Learning
Try to learn the package of [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html).

- [General Caret Functions](./caret functions/Tuning Parameters.nb.html)

## Supervised Learning

- [SVM](./svm/svm.nb.html)

## Unsupervised Learning

- [Kmeans](./kmeans/kmeans.nb.html)


## Time Series Analysis

- [Time Series General Plots](./time series/ts_plots.nb.html)

- [Time Series Train](./time series/ts_trains.nb.html)

## Parallel Computing in Caret package

If the computation takes too long, use parallel computing may speed up your algorithm
